<title>The Distance of the Moon</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>In an episode we last featured on our <a href="https://radiolab.org/radiolab-kids"><i>Radiolab for Kids Feed</i></a> back in 2020, and in honor of its blocking out the Sun for a bit of us for a bit last week, in this episode, we’re gonna talk more about the moon. According to one theory, (psst listen to <a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/the-moon-itself"><i>The Moon Itself</i></a> if you want to know more) the moon formed when a Mars-sized chunk of rock collided with Earth, the moon coalesced out of the debris from that impact. And it was MUCH closer to Earth than it is today. This idea is taken to its fanciful limit in Italo Calvino's story "The Distance of the Moon" (from his collection Cosmicomics, translated by William Weaver). Read by Liev Schreiber, the story is narrated by a character with the impossible-to-pronounce name Qfwfq, and tells of a strange crew who jump between Earth and moon, and sometimes hover in the nether reaches of gravity between the two.</p><p>This reading was part of a live event hosted by Radiolab and Selected Shorts, and it originally aired on WNYC’s and <a href="https://www.symphonyspace.org/selected-shorts">PRI’s SELECTED SHORTS</a>, hosted by BD Wong and paired with a Ray Bradbury classic, “All Summer in a Day,” read by musical theater star Michael Cerveris.</p><p><i>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

<title>The Moon Itself</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>There’s a total solar eclipse coming. On Monday, April 8, for a large swath of North America, the sun will disappear, in the middle of the day. Everywhere you look, people are talking about it. What will it feel like when the sun goes away? What will the blocked-out sun look like? But all this talk of the <i>sun</i> got us thinking: wait, what about the <i>moon</i>? The only reason this whole solar eclipse thing is happening is because the moon is stepping in front of the sun. So in today’s episode, we stop treating the moon like a bit player in this epic cosmic event, and place it centerstage. We get to know the moon, itself — from birth, to middle age, to … death.</p><p>This episode was reported by Molly Webster, Pat Walters, Becca Bressler, Alan Goffinski, Maria Paz Guttierez, Sarah Qari, Simon Adler and Alex Neason, and produced by Matt Kielty, Becca Bressler, Pat Walters, Maria Paz Guttierrez, Alan Goffinski and Simon Adler. </p><p>It was edited by Becca Bressler and Pat Walters.
